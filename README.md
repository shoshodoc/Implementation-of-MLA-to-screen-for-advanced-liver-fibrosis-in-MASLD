This is the python code for the paper: 
"implementation of machine learning algorithms to screen for advanced liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated 
steatotic liver disease (MASLD): an in-depth explanatory analysis".
The aim was to fit and validate a machine learning algorithm to detect advanced liver fibrosis in MASLD patients diagnosed at the primary care setting based on 
readily available demographic, clinical and laboratory features.
In addition, a thorough explanatory analysis was conducted to provide the clinicians with deeper understanding of the model predictions,
and with patterns suggestive of a false postive classification. 

All the code is provided in a single file.
